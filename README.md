What is split-wise app?

It do Debt-simplification in a group of people.

Debt-simplification is a feature of Splitwise that restructures debt within groups of people. 
It does not change the total amount that anyone owes, 
but it makes it easier to pay people back by minimizing the total number of payments.

For example: 

say, Anna, Bob, and Charlie share an apartment. 
Anna owes Bob $20, and Bob owes Charlie $20. Rather than making two separate payments, 
Splitwise would tell Anna to pay $20 to Charlie directly, thereby minimizing the total number of payments being made. 
This ensures that people are paid back more quickly and efficiently.
